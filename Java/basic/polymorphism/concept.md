    3.1 when multiple function with same name but different parameters then these function will called as overloaded.
    3.2 function can be overloaded by changing in the number of argument or cahnge in the type of arguments.

        3.3a: change the type of argument.
        3.3b: change the number of argument.

4. in java, runtime polymorphism known as Dynamic Methods Dispatch.
5. child object will overrid the parent class method.
